## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch
3. Add your rule to `src/rules/`
4. Submit a pull request

### Adding a New Rule

Rules should be added as JSON files in `src/rules/` following this structure:
```json
{
  "category": "category_name",
  "title": "Rule Title",
  "description": "Brief description",
  "recommended_globs": ["glob patterns"],
  "content": [
    "# Rule Title",
    "",
    "// Description: Brief description",
    "// Recommended Globs: glob patterns",
    "",
    "## Section",
    "- Guideline 1",
    "- Guideline 2"
  ]
}
```

The rule will be transformed into an MDC file with frontmatter:
```markdown
---
description: Brief description
globs: glob patterns
---

# Rule Title

// Description: Brief description
// Recommended Globs: glob patterns

## Section
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

### Rule Components
- `category`: One of `code_style`, `frontend`, `backend`, `database`, `mobile`, `desktop_extension`, `mcp_servers_browser_tools`
- `title`: Clear, concise title in Title Case
- `description`: Single sentence explaining the rule's purpose
- `recommended_globs`: Array of glob patterns for file matching (e.g., `["**/*.{js,ts}"]`)
- `content`: Array of markdown strings forming the rule documentation
